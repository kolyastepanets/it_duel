The main task of the player is to clear the playing field from the cells by clicking on adjacent cells of the same color.
You can not remove single cells. Adjacent are 2 or more cells standing side by side.

### Possible options to run
[dfs wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
```
ruby run.rb dfs
ruby run.rb dfs_bottom - start searching from matrix's bottom
ruby run.rb big_dfs - search by biggest figure with dfs algorithm
```
[astar wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
```
ruby run.rb astar 
```

[bfs wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

```
ruby run.rb bfs
ruby run.rb big_bfs - search by biggest figure with bfs algorithm
ruby run.rb solution - draw matrix in console step by step and with all steps
ruby run.rb bfs all_steps - add all_steps argument to show all steps
```
### Benchmark on matrixs 5x5
```
ruby run.rb bench astar
ruby run.rb bench dfs
ruby run.rb bench dfs_bottom
ruby run.rb bench big_dfs
ruby run.rb bench bfs
ruby run.rb bench bfs_bottom
ruby run.rb bench big_dfs
```

### Matrix
There are 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8 matrixs that are solvable - they are not generated by random numbers
